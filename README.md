# üíª How to run the code

## Matlab part

Assume to have collected the S-parameters using a four-port Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). To pre-process the data using the Para Hermitian Eigenvalue Decomposition method, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/nicolaNovello/S-PBHD/tree/main/MatlabPreProcessing). 

## Python part

The directory where the scripts are must contain an additional folder `Datasets` containing 3 folders: `Lambdas`, `Cauchy`, and `Raw`. `Lambdas` and `Cauchy` contain the `.mat` files for the datasets of 0,1, and 2 people obtained using the corresponding pre-processing algorithms. `Raw` contains 3 folders (one for each class): `Empty`, `Person`, and `Two_People` that contain the `s4p` files obtained from the Matlab part. 

The file `main.py` runs the experiments. 
```
python3 main.py --mode Lambdas 
```
Where "mode" identifies the pre-processing algorithm used, which can be: Lambdas, Cauchy, No. 
  
The files `main_functions.py`, `classes.py`, and `utils.py` comprise the needed methods and classes.
