Read-Me: MATLAB Code Overview for Two_people_machine_PhEVD.m
Purpose:

The Two_people_machine_PhEVD.m script is designed to perform signal processing on data from network analyzer measurements, specifically utilizing the s-parameters of a Four-port network to analyze and extract various matrix operations. The script employs concepts such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), matrix convolutions, and Para-hermitian Eigenvalue Decomposition (PhEVD) to process frequency-domain data.
Features:

    Loading S-Parameter Data:
        The script loads and processes .s4p (Touchstone) files, which are frequency-domain network parameters for multi-port networks.
        For each of the 320 files (file1), it uses sparameters to extract the s-parameter data from the corresponding file.

    Matrix Initialization:
        Arrays H, Hf, and R are initialized to store the processed data in both the time and frequency domains. These are 4x4 matrices with dimensionality based on the frequency points.

    FFT and Matrix Convolution:
        Each S-parameter matrix undergoes an Inverse FFT (IFFT) to convert the data from the frequency domain to the time domain.
        A matrix convolution is then applied to generate R matrices, which are further processed using parametric Hermitian operations (ParaHerm and PolyMatConv).

    Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD):
        The script applies Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) to each processed Polynomial matrix. The Eigenvalues are calculated for each frequency bin of the Fourier-transformed matrices.

    Result Storage:
        The resulting matrices, including Eigenvalues, are stored for further analysis. Arrays Lambda1, Lambda2, and EigVals hold these results.

Key Functions Used:

    sparameters: Extracts S-parameters from Touchstone files.
    ifft: Performs Inverse Fast Fourier Transform.
    PolyMatConv: A custom function for polynomial matrix convolution.
    ParaHerm: Likely a custom function to apply Hermitian processing to matrices.
    eig: MATLABâ€™s built-in function for eigenvalue decomposition.
    ParaHermDFT: A function for parametric Hermitian-based Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

Instructions to Run:

    Ensure all necessary .s4p files (numbered 1.s4p to 320.s4p) are available in the working directory.
    Run the script in MATLAB.
    The script processes all files and computes the required matrices and Eigenvalues.
    The final results are stored in H, Hf, R, Rf, and EigVals.

Dependencies:

This script requires the following custom functions:

    PolyMatConv
    ParaHerm
    ParaHermDFT

Ensure these functions are available in the MATLAB path.
Output:

The script generates a variety of matrices (H, Hf, R, Rf) and computes eigenvalues, which are stored in EigVals. These can be used for further analysis or visualized to interpret the system's behavior across the frequency spectrum.
Notes:

    Modify the num variable if you are working with a different number of .s4p files.
    The script uses complex matrix operations and requires sufficient computational resources, particularly memory, to handle large datasets.
